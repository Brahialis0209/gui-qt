The simplex method is an iterative process of the directed solution of a system of equations in steps,
which begins with a supporting solution and, in search of a better option,
moves along the corner points of the region of an acceptable solution that improves
the value of the objective function until the objective function reaches the optimal value.

Instruction:
1. Select the number of rows and variables
2. Enter coefficients for the set of constraints
3. Enter coefficients for the goal function
4. Enter constraints on the variables


If the data is correct, the program will calculate the answer,
otherwise it will tell you where you entered it incorrectly.


If the problem has a solution and there are exactly 2 variables,
then you can depict the search for the optimal plan on the graph,
the points will move along the vertices of the closed polygon.
